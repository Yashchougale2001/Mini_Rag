Artificial Intelligence is the broad field of building intelligent systems.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that learns from data.

Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers.

LSTM and GRU are types of recurrent neural networks used for sequence data.

Transformers use attention mechanisms and power modern LLMs.

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.
